Data size 10000 and has total 14 attributes
Model used : ANN - ACCURACY -85% e.g make sure when you use ANN , you need to scale your data for better & faster performence and fastest convergence in global minima
Model used: CatBoost: ACCURACY: 85.9% .. CatBoost is one of the best GradientBoosting Algorithm. which is known for faster perforemence as compare to LightGBM,H2o,XgBoost.
it works very well with less amount of data , handle categorical features and missing values also.
